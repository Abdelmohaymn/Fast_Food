# Fast_Food!

Itâ€™s a Recipe app has a lot of recipes from spoonacular API with many features.
I used mvvm design pattern, navigation component, room database to store
favorite recipes and also store the primary result to increase the performance
specially when there is no connection, kotlin coroutines, Rx java.

## the project is  not completed yet ##

here are some screenshots of the app
